# Griglia Campo Minato

## Description 

### Delivery
- The user clicks on a button which will generate a square game grid.
- Each cell has a progressive number, from 1 to 100.
- There will therefore be 10 boxes for each of the 10 rows.
- When the user clicks on each cell, the clicked cell turns blue and I issue a message in the console with the number of the clicked cell.

### *Bonuses*
Only if the basic exercise works perfectly: create a new folder called *bonus* and copy all the files and folders of the basic exercise into it except the .git folder.
Then proceed to implement the bonus as follows.
- Add a select next to the spawn button, which provides a choice between three different difficulty levels:
    - with difficulty 1 => 100 boxes, with a number between 1 and 100, divided into 10 boxes by 10 rows;
    - with difficulty 2 => 81 boxes, with a number between 1 and 81, divided into 9 boxes by 9 rows;
    - with difficulty 3 => 49 boxes, with a number between 1 and 49, divided into 7 boxes by 7 rows;
